### Built with

- React javascript
- CSS custom properties and dynamically rendered css classes
- Flexbox

### What I learned

1)JSX -
I learnt the layout for a responsive navbar.
The project featured four blocks of nav bar items grouped to ensure responsiveness.
Also i noted to create another container wrapping the <ul> </ul> to enable me perform logic

2. Css:
   I learnt how to layer the classes for responsive design.
   e.g
   navbar - with the bg and color for mobile and flex for desktop
   hiding of toggle for desktop and hiding social for mobile
   links container with an height of zero and giving an height on show.

3. React:
   Learnt how to combine useEffect, useRef and useState
   Practical example of useRef hook - navbars,forms.
   .getBoundingClientRect() - for getting dimensions of elements
   Refresher on vanilla javascript method of accessing css properties.

Overall it was a wonderful process.
